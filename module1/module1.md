> Welcome to Module 1. In this module, we're gonna start off by talking
> about what is ReactJS and why you should use it. Moving forward, we're
> gonna talk about React Elements and how they are the building blocks
> that represent DOM nodes. After that, we're gonna talk about JSX,
> which is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML code in your
> JavaScript. After that, we're gonna talk about functional components
> which are independent reasonable components that describe how the UI
> should look like based on its state and properties. And lastly, we're
> gonna learn how to arrange functional components to model an
> application in an efficient and clean manner.
