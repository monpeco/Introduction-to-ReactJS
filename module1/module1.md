# Setting Up ReactJS

The following steps are used to add ReactJS to an HTML file:

1. Create an HTML file
 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">

 
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

2. Add scripts to include react.js, react-dom.js and babel.js inside the head of the HTML file

```html

```

3. Add a babel script within the body of the HTML file

```html

```

4. Add <div id="root></div> to the body of the HTML file

```html

```

5. Start rendering elements using ReactJS
