# Class Components

In addition to being written as a function, React Components can also be written using **ES6 classes**. 
**Class Components** differ from **Functional Components** because they allow React Components to have 
**life cycle methods** and **state**. Class components have two instance properties, `this.state` 
and `this.props`, that represent the component's state and properties respectively.

React Component written using ES6 classes:
```javascript
class Welcome extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    }
}
```

This is the same as the following Functional Component:

```javascript
function Welcome(){
    return <h1>Hello World!</h1>
}
```

Both types of React Components can be used by writing their name within an HTML tag:
```javascript
var element = <Welcome/>
```
